<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Problem Solving 2nd line Engineer with 5+ years of experience completing many private and public IT projects. Possessing a proven ability to administer, configure and maintain computer based information systems, as well as having an eye for detail and able to multi-task under pressure. An excellent communicator, can relate well with people at all levels and has the flexibility of working well as part of a team and on my own in an office, on-site and remotely.</p>

<p>But now I wish to follow my heart and I am excited to pursue a career as a software engineer. My journey began with self-learning, where I explored various programming languages, including Python, HTML5, and MQL4, and I have since built several small projects that have sharpened my technical skills. However, I understand that true growth comes from learning and working in a professional environment, which is why I am eager to become a junior software engineer</p>
